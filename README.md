## ✏️ Customization

[VSCode Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color)

-   Press  `F5`  to open a new window with your extension loaded.
-   Open  `File > Preferences > Color Themes`  and pick your color theme.
-   Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the  `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes`  command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`  or  `Cmd+Shift+P`  on Mac).

## 🛠 Devlopment
Attica was created using the [Theme Studio for VSCode](https://themes.vscode.one).  The Theme Studio for VS Code lets you easily design, and deploy your own VS Code themes from scratch. If you want to create your own fully customized theme I highly recommend checking it out.
